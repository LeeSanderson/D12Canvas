When writing code, follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach:

1. Write a test that fails
2. Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code to make it better
4. Repeat

Once tests are passing and the changes are complete, commit the changes 
using the prompt as the commit message.
